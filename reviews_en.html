        we see how many people eat in this establishment. That's
        decided to stop by and try.
        The menu includes a wide variety of dishes. Nicely,
        that the pictures correspond to reality))
        the waiter who came up to us was a little confused
        (maybe he was new), but immediately he was picked up by another,
        accepted our order and answered all our questions. Nicely,
        that the food came to us very quickly. The portions are large, the food
        delicious, and the price made me happy!

       <font size="4"><b><em>The restaurant hall itself is beautifully decorated in an oriental
        style. The choice of dishes on the menu is large, the food is delicious and is brought quickly, only
        coffee had to wait a bit. There are a lot of waiters and they sneak here and there,
        it seems that they are bowing around idle. It seemed to me not very
        cozy, but liked the open kitchen.

       <font size="4"><b><em>The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of the shopping
        center Berkarar. Soltan has a variety of restaurants all over
        the city, but the best food is served in Bercarar. Turkish food and
        includes soups and kebabs as a second course.
        The food is delicious and served quite quickly, so many of the staff
        offices from neighboring countries love to come there for lunch. Food
        it's pretty cheap there.

        Large selection: they have different menus by food types.
        There are so many employees that it is almost impossible to make your mind.
        The food was good The only problem we faced was
        was that it was very loud that a party was going on
        birthday, loud music and loudspeaker advertisements.
         We couldn't communicate! (PS: No alcohol is served)
